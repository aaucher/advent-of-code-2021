# Advent of Code 2021

The programs I wrote for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). 
They have been developed in Prolog and run on [Scryer Prolog](https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog).

## Notes
The flag `:- set_prolog_flag(double_quotes, chars).` is enabled by
default in Scryer Prolog. This means that `"abc"` is equivalent to
`[a, b, c]` so strings can be handled like lists.
